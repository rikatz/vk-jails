Do not use, WIP!!

It allocates IPs, but the IP stack does not work :/
* Actually this is because we need to add the IP Address to the correct interface (To be implemented)


It creates a Jail, but everything is hardcoded
* Yes, this is the life :/ There's a bunch of TODO and hopefully this is going to be usable soon!!
